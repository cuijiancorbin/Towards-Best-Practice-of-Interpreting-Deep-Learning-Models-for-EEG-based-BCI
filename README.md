# Towards-Best-Practice-of-Interpreting-Deep-Learning-Models-for-EEG-based-BCI
Understanding deep learning models is important for EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI), since it not only can boost trust of end users but also potentially shed light on reasons that cause a model to fail. However, deep learning interpretability has not yet raised wide attention in this field. It remains unknown how reliably existing interpretation techniques can be used and to which extent they can reflect the model decisions. 

In order to fill this research gap, we conduct the first quantitative evaluation and explore the best practice of interpreting deep learning models designed for EEG-based BCI. We design metrics and test seven well-known interpretation techniques on benchmark deep learning models. We propose a set of processing steps that allow the interpretation results to be visualized in an understandable and trusted way.

In the code file "Deep_Learning_Interpretability_samplefile.py", we implemented 7 interpretation techniques on two benchmark deep learning models "EEGNet" and "InterpretableCNN" (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9714736) for EEG-based BCI. The methods include:
    
gradient√óinput, 
DeepLIFT, 
integrated gradient, 
layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP),
saliency map, 
deconvolution,
guided backpropagation

The code are implemented with Pytorch libraty on Python 3.6.6.
Required library: torch, scipy, numpy, matplotlib, mne.
Nvidia GPU is also needed. 

The dataset for the test is available from
